    <p> Greetings, thank you for visiting my portfolio page. I am a graduate of Northwestern Coding bootcamp
            where i received my "Web Developer Certification." I currently reside in Chicago, Illinois.
            Being a programmer has always been an aspiration of mine, and I look forward to work with a company where we
            can both grow as a campany and an individual. Attached you will find links to the work I have done throughout 
            my course at Northwestern. I thank you for taking the time to see my portfolio and see me as a potential candidate.
         </p>
